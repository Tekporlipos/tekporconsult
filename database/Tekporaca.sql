(1, 'books/numerical_analisys1.png', 'Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). Numerical analysis naturally finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st century also the life sciences, social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. The growth in computing power has revolutionized the use of realistic mathematical models in science and engineering, and subtle numerical analysis is required to implement these detailed models of the world. For example, ordinary differential equations appear in celestial mechanics (predicting the motions of planets, stars and galaxies); numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis; stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of modern computers, numerical methods often depended on hand interpolation formulas applied to data from large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead, but many of the same formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe numerical point of view goes back to the earliest mathematical writings. A tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC 7289), gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the square root of 2, the length of the diagonal in a unit square. Computing the sides of a triangle in terms of square roots is a basic practical problem, for example in astronomy, carpentry, and construction.[2]\r\n\r\nNumerical analysis continues this long tradition: rather than exact symbolic answers, which can only be applied to real-world measurements by translation into digits, it gives approximate solutions within specified error bounds.', 'WBHouse', 'Sciences', 'Mathematics / Computer Science / Computer Engineering ', 'Numerical_Analysis', '../Category/CollageOfScience/Mathematics/MATH 270 All Units Copy.pdf', ' <iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3&resid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3%217186&authkey=ANd-JUi8dkMkAPE&em=2" width="100%" height="" id="bookreader" frameborder="0" scrolling="yes"></iframe>', 'ONANSSIS', '2020-03-16 03:59:33', NULL),

EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data.

(3, 'books/StratifiedRandomSampling.jpg', 'In statistical surveys, when subpopulations within an overall population vary, it could be advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should define a partition of the population. That is, it should be collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to one and only one stratum. Then simple random sampling or systematic sampling is applied within each stratum. The objective is to improve the precision of the sample by reducing sampling error. It can produce a weighted mean that has less variability than the arithmetic mean of a simple random sample of the population.\r\n\r\nIn computational statistics, stratified sampling is a method of variance reduction when Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate population statistics from a known population.[1]\r\n\r\nAssume that we need to estimate the average number of votes for each candidate in an election. Assume that a country has 3 towns: Town A has 1 million factory workers, Town B has 2 million office workers and Town C has 3 million retirees. We can choose to get a random sample of size 60 over the entire population but there is some chance that the resulting random sample is poorly balanced across these towns and hence is biased, causing a significant error in estimation. Instead if we choose to take a random sample of 10, 20 and 30 from Town A, B and C respectively, then we can produce a smaller error in estimation for the same total sample size. This method is generally used when a population is not a homogeneous group.

Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\r\n\r\nTime series are very frequently plotted via line charts. Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements.\r\n\r\nTime series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series, this type of analysis of time series is not called "time series analysis", which focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time. Interrupted time series analysis is the analysis of interventions on a single time series.\r\n\r\nTime series data have a natural temporal ordering. This makes time series analysis distinct from cross-sectional studies, in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people''s wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals'' data could be entered in any order). Time series analysis is also distinct from spatial data analysis where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A stochastic model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see time reversibility.)

Historically, the random variables were associated with or indexed by a set of numbers, usually viewed as points in time, giving the interpretation of a stochastic process representing numerical values of some system randomly changing over time, such as the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule.[1][4][5][6] Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. They have applications in many disciplines including sciences such as biology,[7] chemistry,[8] ecology,[9] neuroscience,[10] and physics[11] as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing,[12] information theory,[13] computer science,[14] cryptography[15] and telecommunications.[16] Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.[17][18][19]\r\n\r\nApplications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process,[a] used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse,[22] and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time.[23] These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes,[1][4][24] and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.[22][25]\r\n\r\nThe term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process,[26][27] because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space.[28][29] The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables.[28][30] But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line.[5][30] If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead.[5][31] The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.[5][29]\r\n\r\nBased on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories, which include random walks,[32] martingales,[33] Markov processes,[34] Lévy processes,[35] Gaussian processes,[36] random fields,[37] renewal processes, and branching processes.[38] The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology[39][40][41] as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis.[42][43][44] The theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics[45] and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications.[46][47][48] ', 'WBHouse', 'Sciences', 'Mathematics', 'Stochastic_process_1', '../Category/CollageOfScience/ComputerScience/stocatic_process_11.pdf', '<iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3&resid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3%217903&authkey=AC-ja7Iax1Mor00&em=2" width="100%" height="" frameborder="0" id="bookreader" scrolling="no"></iframe>', 'Yao Elikem Ayekple', '2020-03-19 02:58:33', NULL),
(9, 'books/regressionana.png', 'In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the ''outcome variable'') and one or more independent variables (often called ''predictors'', ''covariates'', or ''features''). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which a researcher finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared distances between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis[1]) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).\r\n\r\nRegression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes. First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate causal relationships using observational data.[2][3] ', 'WBHouse', 'Sciences', 'Mathematics', 'Introduction_to_Regression_Analysis', '../Category/CollageOfScience/ComputerScience/MATH 369_Regression Analysis_IDL.pdf', '<iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3&resid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3%2110078&authkey=ANBRLe0XxNwFlfU&em=2" width="100%" height="" id="bookreader" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>', 'A.

(32, 'books/dmathenote.png', 'Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic[1] – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.[2][3] Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers. More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets[4] (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics."[5] Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.\r\n\r\nThe set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.\r\n\r\nResearch in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations research.\r\n\r\nAlthough the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.\r\n\r\nIn university curricula, "Discrete Mathematics" appeared in the 1980s, initially as a computer science support course; its contents were somewhat haphazard at the time. The curriculum has thereafter developed in conjunction with efforts by ACM and MAA into a course that is basically intended to develop mathematical maturity in first-year students; therefore it is nowadays a prerequisite for mathematics majors in some universities as well.[6][7] Some high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well.[8] At this level, discrete mathematics is sometimes seen as a preparatory course, not unlike precalculus in this respect.[9]\r\n\r\nThe Fulkerson Prize is awarded for outstanding papers in discrete mathematics.

They have applications in many disciplines including sciences such as biology,[7] chemistry,[8] ecology,[9] neuroscience,[10] and physics[11] as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing,[12] information theory,[13] computer science,[14] cryptography[15] and telecommunications.[16] Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.[17][18][19]\r\n\r\nApplications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process,[a] used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse,[22] and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time.[23] These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes,[1][4][24] and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.[22][25]\r\n\r\nThe term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process,[26][27] because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space.[28][29] The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables.[28][30] But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line.[5][30] If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead.[5][31] The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.[5][29]\r\n\r\nBased on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories, which include random walks,[32] martingales,[33] Markov processes,[34] Lévy processes,[35] Gaussian processes,[36] random fields,[37] renewal processes, and branching processes.[38] The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology[39][40][41] as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis.[42][43][44] The theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics[45] and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications.[46][47][48] ', 'WBHouse', 'Sciences', 'Mathematics', 'Stochastic_process_11', '../Category/CollageOfScience/Mathematics/stocatic_process_11.pdf', '<iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3&amp;resid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3%2110126&amp;authkey=AEu4pFHD1y1HtDg&amp;em=2&amp;wdStartOn=1" width="100%" height="" id="bookreader"  frameborder="0">This is an embedded <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com">Microsoft Office</a> PDF, powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com/webapps">Office</a>.</iframe>', 'Creative Commons', '2020-03-25 02:58:33', NULL),

The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.

It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nFCL provides the user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and network communications. Programmers produce software by combining their source code with .NET Framework and other libraries. The framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment for .NET software called Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n.NET Framework began as proprietary software, although the firm worked to standardize the software stack almost immediately, even before its first release. Despite the standardization efforts, developers, mainly those in the free and open-source software communities, expressed their unease with the selected terms and the prospects of any free and open-source implementation, especially regarding software patents. Since then, Microsoft has changed .NET development to more closely follow a contemporary model of a community-developed software project, including issuing an update to its patent promising to address the concerns.[2]\r\n\r\n.NET Framework led to a family of .NET platforms targeting mobile computing, embedded devices, alternative operating systems, and web browser plug-ins. A reduced version of the framework, .NET Compact Framework, is available on Windows CE platforms, including Windows Mobile devices such as smartphones. .NET Micro Framework is targeted at very resource-constrained embedded devices. Silverlight was available as a web browser plugin.

The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[9]\r\n\r\nThe concept of algorithm has existed since antiquity. Arithmetic algorithms, such as a division algorithm, was used by ancient Babylonian mathematicians c. 2500 BC and Egyptian mathematicians c. 1550 BC.[10] Greek mathematicians later used algorithms in the sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers,[11] and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.[12] Arabic mathematicians such as Al-Kindi in the 9th century used cryptographic algorithms for code-breaking, based on frequency analysis.[13]\r\n\r\nThe word algorithm itself is derived from the 9th-century Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, Latinized Algoritmi.[14] A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define "effective calculability"[15] or "effective method".[16] Those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church''s lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post''s Formulation 1 of 1936, and Alan Turing''s Turing machines of 1936–37 and 1939.

In survey sampling, weights can be applied to the data to adjust for the sample design, particularly in stratified sampling.[1] Results from probability theory and statistical theory are employed to guide the practice. In business and medical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a population.[2] Acceptance sampling is used to determine if a production lot of material meets the governing specifications.

(63, 'books/intogeology.png', 'Geology (from the Ancient Greek γῆ, gē ("earth") and -λoγία, -logia, ("study of", "discourse")[1][2]) is an earth science concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time. Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other earth sciences, including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences, and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated earth system science and planetary science.\r\nAerial view of Grand Prismatic Spring; Hot Springs, Midway & Lower Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park\r\nKinney Lake and Mount Whitehorn near Mount Robson, Canada\r\n\r\nGeology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface, and the processes that have shaped that structure. It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given location, and also to describe the histories of those rocks.[3] By combining these tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole, and also to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth''s past climates.\r\n\r\nGeologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth''s structure and evolution, including field work, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding of natural hazards, the remediation of environmental problems, and providing insights into past climate change. Geology is a major academic discipline, and it plays an important role in geotechnical engineering. \r\n', 'WBHouse', 'Sciences,Engineering', 'Physics,Geology', 'PHY_387_INTRODUCTORY_GEOLOGY', '../Category/CollageOfScience/Physics/intro geology.pdf', '<iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3&resid=7BD7C6D52AF6BFA3%216368&authkey=ACZ2NjfiqKlira4&em=2"  width="100%" height="" id="bookreader" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>', 'K.

The study of meteorology dates back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century. The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions. Prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data. It was not until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved. An important domain of weather forecasting is marine weather forecasting as it relates to maritime and coastal safety, in which weather effects also include atmospheric interactions with large bodies of water.\r\n\r\nMeteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology. Meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of Earth''s atmosphere: temperature, air pressure, water vapour, mass flow, and the variations and interactions of those variables, and how they change over time. Different spatial scales are used to describe and predict weather on local, regional, and global levels.\r\n\r\nMeteorology, climatology, atmospheric physics, and atmospheric chemistry are sub-disciplines of the atmospheric sciences. Meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology. The interactions between Earth''s atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military, energy production, transport, agriculture, and construction.

The first magnetic compasses were made from lodestones, while more modern magnetic compasses played an important role in the history of navigation. The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD. Isaac Newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the precession of the equinox; and instruments were developed to measure the Earth''s shape, density and gravity field, as well as the components of the water cycle. In the 20th century, geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics.\r\n\r\nGeophysics is applied to societal needs, such as mineral resources, mitigation of natural hazards and environmental protection.[4] In Exploration geophysics, geophysical survey data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits, locate groundwater, find archaeological relics, determine the thickness of glaciers and soils, and assess sites for environmental remediation.

As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space (see population dynamics). Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population.\r\n\r\nDemographic analysis can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity. Educational institutions[2] usually treat demography as a field of sociology, though there are a number of independent demography departments.[3] Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth''s population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers.\r\n\r\nFormal demography limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of social demography or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.[4] ', 'WBHouse', 'Science', 'Mathematics', 'Demography_(statistical_study_of_populations)', 0, 14, 60, '2020-03-01 05:16:32', NULL),

(4, 'images/state.png', 'In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the ''outcome variable'') and one or more independent variables (often called ''predictors'', ''covariates'', or ''features''). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which a researcher finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared distances between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis[1]) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).\r\n\r\nRegression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes. First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate causal relationships using observational data.[2][3] ', 'WBHouse', 'Science', 'Mathematics', 'Introduction_to_regression_analysis', 0, 14, 60, '2020-03-04 00:00:00', NULL),

You engage in solving problems every day and you start with a question, collect some information, and then form an answer. Research is important for three reasons.1. Research adds to our knowledge: Adding to knowledge means that educators undertake research to contribute to existing information about issues 2.Research improves practice: Research is also important because it suggests improvements for practice. Armed with research results, teachers and other educators become more effective professionals. 3. Research informs policy debates: research also provides information to policy makers when they research and debate educational topics.[2]\r\n\r\nA research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student''s research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemological, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences.
